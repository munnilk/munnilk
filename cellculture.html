    <h1>Cell Culture</h1>
    <p>
        Cell culture has a wide use in academia as well as in industry. It is widely being used in vaccine production,
        cancer research, protein therapeutics, testing biocompatibility of a variety of materials for medical purposes.
        <br>

        To put in simple words cell culture is growing cells in a controlled condition, outside of its native
        environment.

        <br>
        To perform cell culture in a laboratory setting we need to collect cells directly from donor tissue, this is the
        primary cell. The primary cells need to be altered to produce the desirable established cell line. Cell lines
        are produced by transforming primary cells with viral oncogene or chemical treatment.
        <br>
        Start with collecting primary cells of interest. There are two growth conditions 1. Monolayer (also known as
        adherent culture)
        2. Free floating (also known as suspension culture)
        While we let the cell grow, we have to make sure to maintain the optimal condition to allow the cells to
        proliferate. It is important to constantly monitor for optimal temperature, optimal pH, and keeping the cells
        under sterile conditions. Proving the correct media of proper concentration is vital for cells to grow, the most
        commonly used media are PMEM, RPMI and F12. Using a defined media is the best choice. Inorder to maintain ph,
        add sodium bicarbonate/ zwitterion. pH can be easily monitored if pH indicators are added directly to the media,
        thus any change in the appearance will be visible. Always use a biosafety cabinet to avoid contamination.
        Once we have obtained primary cells the next step is to make immortalized cells.
        Before making immortalized cells make sure that the primary cells are contamination free. To check that we can
        use standard tests for mycoplasma and pathogen detection. Once it's certain that the cells are contamination
        free, we can start the immortalization. (Immortalized cells are primary cells whose telomerase/tumor suppressor
        genes have been altered).
        <br>
        To target telomeres, insert cDNA into primary cell coding for TERT protein which induces telomerase activity and
        regenerates telomeres thus preventing synapsis.
        <br>
        Target tumor suppressor gene (Rb, p53) by inserting viral oncogenes, this will inactivate the tumor suppressor
        gene and will allow cell cycle to continue.
        There are two methods available, lentiviral Transduction and plasmid transfection.
        Choice of method and preference will vary depending on the cell type being used.
        If it's a human cell for example, inserting TERT DNA is a good choice as TERT protein naturally occurs in the
        human cell. We have to be cautious though as over expression of TERT may cause the cells to die instead.
        Many cells require use of both methods simultaneously. It is best practice to follow scientific literature
        review to find out about the best method and choice of media if studies were done on similar types of cells.
        Once immortalization is complete we need to verify if the cells are immortal. To do that, passage the primary
        cell and the immortalized cell side by side. Observe their continuous proliferation over time. If the cell line
        last 20 or more passages then the cells can be said to be immortal.
        Additionally the cell should be checked under microscope at regular intervals to see if the cells look healthy
        and if the morphology is as expected. Perform STR(short tandem repeat) profile to make sure no cell
        contamination or to check if there is any population mixing.

        Most of the information was obtained from Applied Biological Materials - ab. I believe alongside the scientific
        journals the informations from the leading biotech companies are reliable source to follow.
