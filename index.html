                        <p>About me: <br>
                                My name is Munni Khandakar. I live in Boston, Massachusetts. By profession I am a
                                Microbiologist, in my leisure time I enjoy learning web designing. This page is my
                                humble attempt to combine my academic background with my hobby. CRISPR is one of my
                                favourite topics. Soon I will add content about the bioceramics.

                                        <p> The CRISPR CAS9 system made the gene editing system dramatically easy. Ever
                                                since the CRISPR CAS9 system was discovered, it has caught the attention
                                                of many scientists. The scientific community without delay understood
                                                the significance of this discovery. Scientists are studying both the
                                                positive and negative aspects of the CRISPR CAS9 system to find out more
                                                about CRISPR and how it can be safely used for the greater good. Hope
                                                you will enjoy reading.
