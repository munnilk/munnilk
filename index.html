                        <p>About me: <br>
                                My name is Munni Khandakar. I live in Boston, Massachusetts. By profession I am a
                                Microbiologist, in my leisure time I enjoy learning web designing. This page is my
                                humble attempt to combine my academic background with my hobby. CRISPR is one of my
                                favourite topics. Soon I will add content about the bioceramics.

                                        <p> The CRISPR CAS9 system made the gene editing system dramatically easy. Ever
                                                since the CRISPR CAS9 system was discovered, it has caught the attention
                                                of many scientists. The scientific community without delay understood
                                                the significance of this discovery. Scientists are studying both the
                                                positive and negative aspects of the CRISPR CAS9 system to find out more
                                                about CRISPR and how it can be safely used for the greater good. Hope
                                                you will enjoy reading.

                                        <p>After biology, statistics is my second most favourite subject. I have done
                                                statistical analysis for two of the peer reviewed journals. One of them
                                                was published, the second is under peer-review. If you are interested in
                                                the Weibull statistical model for failure and reliability predictions
                                                this paper is for you. Please feel free to take a look at “​​Flexural
                                                strength and load–deflection behaviour of hybrid thermoset composites of
                                                wood and canola biopolymers
                                                (https://doi.org/10.1007/s42765-021-00089-5)”. The upcoming paper will
                                                have statistical analysis based on MANOVA (multivariate analysis of
                                                variance). </p>

                                        <p>I will be uploading a few python games that I have created while learning
                                                python. These are very basic and easy games. If you too are thinking
                                                about starting coding, please do not delay. It's a really exciting and
                                                fulfilling experience.
                                        </p>
