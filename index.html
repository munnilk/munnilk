                        <p>About me: <br>
                                My name is Lovely K. M. Khandakar. I live in Boston, Massachusetts, and love to study
                                science,
                                particularly microbiology and chemistry. I like to read biology related journal
                                articles. In my
                                leisure time I enjoy learning web designing. This page is my
                                humble attempt to combine my academic background with my hobby. CRISPR is one of my
                                favourite topics. Soon I will add more contents, including biomaterials and sensors.

                                        <p> The CRISPR CAS9 system made the gene editing system dramatically easy. Ever
                                                since the CRISPR CAS9 system was discovered, it has caught the attention
                                                of many scientists. The scientific community without delay understood
                                                the significance of this discovery. Scientists are studying both the
                                                positive and negative aspects of the CRISPR CAS9 system to find out more
                                                about CRISPR and how it can be safely used for the greater good. Hope
                                                you will enjoy reading.

                                        <p>After biology, statistics is my second most favourite subject. I have done
                                                statistical analysis for two of the peer reviewed journals. One of them
                                                was published, the second is under peer-review. If you are interested in
                                                the Weibull statistical model for failure and reliability predictions,
                                                this paper is for you:

                                        <p>I will be uploading a few python games that I have created while learning
                                                python. These are very basic and easy games. If you too are thinking
                                                about starting coding, please do not delay. It's a really exciting and
                                                fulfilling experience.
