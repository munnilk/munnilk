                                                CRISPR
                                                CAS9 system made the gene editing dramatically easy. Ever since CRISPR
                                                was
                                                discovered, it has caught the attention of many scientists. The
                                                scientific
                                                community without delay understood the significance of this discovery.

                                                CRISPR and how it can be safely used for the greater good. Hope you will
