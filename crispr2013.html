    <h1>Heritable genome editing in C. elegans via a crisPr-cas9 system</h1>
    <p>In this article the researcher performed CRISPR Cas9 gene editing in the Caenorhabditis elegans germ line using
        single-guide RNAs and successfully established heritable genetic alterations in C. elegans. A step by step
        procedure was provided on how to identify U6 snRNA pol III promoter and target sequence for the sgRNA. It
        describes the complete construct of the plasmid and how Cas9, sgRNAs and mCherry marker vectors were
        microinjected into adult worms. The RNA was later isolated and identified by performing RT-PCR assays. The
        result of the disruption was detected from f1 generation. Inheritance of targeted disruptions was studied along
        the f2 progeny. </p>

            (a) Experimental design to screen for mutants with phenotypes derived from worms injected with CRISPR-Cas
            expression vectors. (b,c) Sequences of the indel mutations found in our unc-119 and dpy-13 mutant lines (b)
            and klp-12 and Y61A9LA.1 mutant lines (c). Insertions are marked in blue, deletions are marked by dashes,
            and the PAMs are marked in purple. Numbers to the right of the sequences indicate the net loss or gain of
            bases for each allele, with the number of bases inserted (+) or deleted (âˆ’) indicated in parentheses. (d)
            Restriction digest analysis of PCR amplicons spanning the klp-12 cleavage site from seven F1 worms (1%
            agarose gel). M, 1 kb plus DNA ladder (Thermo Scientific) (Friedland et al., 2013).
