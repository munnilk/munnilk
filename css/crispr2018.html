    <h1>Effect of CRISPER gene drive system in the wild population</h1>
    <p>In this article the researcher produced a mathematical model to calculate efficiency of gene drive system is
        effcted by the drive resistant allel. Presence of drive-resistant allele reduces the efficiency of CRISPR-based
        gene drive systems. Mathematical tools were developed to analyse the efficiency of the gene drive system. The
        aim is to quantify the possibility and extent of the spread of the gene drive system.
        One of the crucial steps of the CRISPR-based gene drive system is the breaking of the double strand. The break
        in the double strand is repaired by either of the two way, homology directed repair or non-homologous repair
        pathway. When the nonhomologous pathway is the used for the repairing of the broken DNA, there is a possibility
        of creating mutation due to the mechanism.
