    <h1>Simple Python Game</h1>
    <p>Here I have attached the code and a short video clip to show how the code works. The game is not complete yet but
        should be enough to begin customizing your own game/quiz. </p>

        print ('Awesome! Lets begin.') <br>
        else: <br>
        print ('Its okay. Maybe next time. Bye bye!') <br>
        time.sleep(10000) <br>

        else: <br>
        print ('OOPS! That is not correct. Please try again') <br>
        print('It has been a long day') <br>
        print('I am too tired to talk. We can chat again later.') <br>
        print('Goodbye', name, 'I liked chatting with you') <br>
