<h1>CRISPER gene drive</h1>

<p> This article discus the impact of evolution in gene drive system. It is important to undertand
    the impact of
    releasing of
    modified organism in the wild. This article will give a insight chanlleges that along with the pressence of drive
    resisant allel and how to bring about evolutionary stability in the gene drive system. The figure below is a
    representation of the gene drive system in a super-Mendelian fashion.
    The end result, evolution stability and the impact releasing the modified organism depend on the repair mechanism
    used using the repairing the gene drive procedure. Wether the repair system used was homologous/ non homologous
    recombinatoion makes a huge differnce.
