<h1>CRISPER gene drive</h1>

<p>
    This article discusses the impact of evolution in the gene drive system. It is important to understand the impact of
    releasing modified organisms in the wild. This article will give an insight of the challenges that come along with
    the presence of drive resistant alleles and how to bring about evolutionary stability in the gene drive system. The
    figure below is a representation of the gene drive system in a super-Mendelian fashion. As per this article, the end
    result, evolution stability and the impact of releasing the modified organism depend on the repair mechanism used
    during the gene drive procedure. Whether the repair system used was homologous/ non homologous recombination makes a
    significant difference.

    <figcaption>CRISPR gene drive inheritance and spread in wild populations. (A) Inheritance and spread of a gene drive
        construct, D, in a population of individuals
        homozygous for the wild type, W. In the late germ line, the drive construct induces a DSB at its own position on
        the homologous chromosome, which is repaired
        either by HR, converting the individual to a DD homozygote, or by NHEJ, producing a small
        insertion/deletion/substitution mutation at the cut site, which results in a
        drive-resistant allele. There is also the possibility of no modification, in which case the W allele remains
        unchanged. This mechanism can lead to rapid spread of the
        gene drive in a population or spread of resistant alleles, depending on their relative fitness effects. (B) To
        achieve this mechanism, previously demonstrated drive
        constructs are inserted at some target sequence (blue) and carry a CRISPR nuclease (for example, Cas9) with a
        gRNA, as well as a “cargo gene,” which can be chosen
        arbitrarily for the desired application. Disruption of the target sequence must be nearly neutral for the drive
        to spread. (C) The construct modeled here, which was
        proposed by Esvelt et al. (2), reconstitutes the target gene after cutting—so an essential gene can be chosen as
        the target to select against resistant alleles—and uses
        multiple (n) gRNAs (Noble et al., 2017).
